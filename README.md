# En-Vi-Translator-Transformer
English-Vietnamese Translator using Transformer  This project implements a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates English sentences into Vietnamese using the Transformer architecture. The model is trained on a parallel English-Vietnamese dataset and achieves competitive results measured by BLEU scores.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture using PyTorch
- Custom tokenization and vocabulary building
- Training pipeline with early stopping
- Evaluation using both sentence-level and corpus-level BLEU scores
- Greedy decoding for inference
- Pretrained model saving and loading support

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- TorchText
- pandas
- matplotlib
- nltk
